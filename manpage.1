.SH MkDocs Manpage
.PP
MkDocs plugin to generate a manpage from the documentation site.
.SS Requirements
.PP
Pandoc must be installed (https://pandoc.org/installing.html) and available as \f[V]pandoc\f[R].
.SS Installation
.PP
With \f[V]pip\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install mkdocs-manpage[preprocess]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
With \f[V]pipx\f[R] (https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
python3.8 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install mkdocs-manpage[preprocess]
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Usage
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
- manpage:
    pages:
    - index.md
    - usage.md
    - reference/api.md
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To enable/disable the plugin with an environment variable:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# mkdocs.yml
plugins:
- manpage:
    enabled: !ENV [MANPAGE, false]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then set the environment variable and run MkDocs:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
MANPAGE=true mkdocs build
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The manpage will be written into the root of the site directory and named \f[V]manpage.1\f[R].
.SS Pre-processing HTML
.PP
This plugin works by concatenating the HTML from all selected pages into a single file that is then converted to a manual page using Pandoc.
.PP
With a complete conversion, the final manual page will not look so good.
For example images and SVG will be rendered as long strings of data and/or URIs.
So this plugin allows users to pre-process the HTML, to remove unwanted HTML elements before converting the whole thing to a manpage.
.PP
First, you must make sure to install the \f[V]preprocess\f[R] extra:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install mkdocs-manpage[preprocess]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
To pre-process the HTML, we use BeautifulSoup (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/).
Users have to write their own \f[V]preprocess\f[R] function in order to modify the soup returned by BeautifulSoup:
scripts/preprocess.py
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup, Tag


def to_remove(tag: Tag) -> bool:
    # remove images and SVGs
    if tag.name in {\[dq]img\[dq], \[dq]svg\[dq]}:
        return True
    # remove links containing images or SVGs
    if tag.name == \[dq]a\[dq] and tag.img and to_remove(tag.img):
        return True
    # remove permalinks
    if tag.name == \[dq]a\[dq] and \[dq]headerlink\[dq] in tag.get(\[dq]class\[dq], ()):
        return True
    return False


def preprocess(soup: BeautifulSoup) -> None:
    for element in soup.find_all(to_remove):
        element.decompose()
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then, instruct the plugin to use this module and its \f[V]preprocess\f[R] function:
mkdocs.yml
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
plugins:
- manpage:
    preprocess: scripts/preprocess.py
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
See the documentation of both \f[V]BeautifulSoup\f[R] and \f[V]Tag\f[R] to know what methods are available to correctly select the elements to remove.
.PP
The alternative to HTML processing for improving the final manpage is disabling some options from other plugins/extensions:
.IP \[bu] 2
no source code through \f[V]mkdocstrings\f[R]:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- mkdocstrings:
    handlers:
      python:
        options:
          show_source: !ENV [SHOW_SOURCE, true]
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
no permalink through \f[V]toc\f[R]:
.RS 2
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
markdown_extensions:
- toc:
    permalink: !ENV [PERMALINK, true]
\f[R]
.fi
.RE
.PP
Then set these environment variables before building the documentation and generating the manpage:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
export MANPAGE=true
export PERMALINK=false
export SHOW_SOURCE=false
mkdocs build
\f[R]
.fi

.SH Contributing
.PP
Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!
Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.
.SS Environment setup
.PP
Nothing easier!
.PP
Fork and clone the repository, then:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cd mkdocs-manpage
make setup
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note
.PP
If it fails for some reason, you\[aq]ll need to install PDM (https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) manually.
.PP
You can install it with:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install pdm
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now you can try running \f[V]make setup\f[R] again, or simply \f[V]pdm install\f[R].
.PP
You now have the dependencies installed.
.PP
Run \f[V]make help\f[R] to see all the available actions!
.SS Tasks
.PP
This project uses duty (https://github.com/pawamoy/duty) to run tasks.
A Makefile is also provided.
The Makefile will try to run certain tasks on multiple Python versions.
If for some reason you don\[aq]t want to run the task on multiple Python versions, you run the task directly with \f[V]pdm run duty TASK\f[R].
.PP
The Makefile detects if a virtual environment is activated, so \f[V]make\f[R] will work the same with the virtualenv activated or not.
.PP
If you work in VSCode, we provide an action to configure VSCode (https://pawamoy.github.io/copier-pdm/work/#vscode-setup) for the project.
.SS Development
.PP
As usual:
.IP "1." 3
create a new branch: \f[V]git switch -c feature-or-bugfix-name\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
edit the code and/or the documentation
.PP
\f[B]Before committing:\f[R]
.IP "1." 3
run \f[V]make format\f[R] to auto-format the code
.IP "2." 3
run \f[V]make check\f[R] to check everything (fix any warning)
.IP "3." 3
run \f[V]make test\f[R] to run the tests (fix any issue)
.IP "4." 3
if you updated the documentation or the project dependencies:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 3
run \f[V]make docs\f[R]
.IP "2." 3
go to <http://localhost:8000> and check that everything looks good
.RE
.IP "5." 3
follow our commit message convention
.PP
If you are unsure about how to fix or ignore a warning, just let the continuous integration fail, and we will help you during review.
.PP
Don\[aq]t bother updating the changelog, we will take care of this.
.SS Commit message convention
.PP
Commit messages must follow our convention based on the Angular style (https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#format-of-the-commit-message) or the Karma convention (https://karma-runner.github.io/4.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html):

\f[C]
<type>[(scope)]: Subject

[Body]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]Subject and body must be valid Markdown.\f[R] Subject must have proper casing (uppercase for first letter if it makes sense), but no dot at the end, and no punctuation in general.
.PP
Scope and body are optional.
Type can be:

.PP
If you write a body, please add trailers at the end (for example issues and PR references, or co-authors), without relying on GitHub\[aq]s flavored Markdown:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Body.

Issue #10: https://github.com/namespace/project/issues/10
Related to PR namespace/other-project#15: https://github.com/namespace/other-project/pull/15
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
These \[dq]trailers\[dq] must appear at the end of the body, without any blank lines between them.
The trailer title can contain any character except colons \f[V]:\f[R].
We expect a full URI for each trailer, not just GitHub autolinks (for example, full GitHub URLs for commits and issues, not the hash or the #issue-number).
.PP
We do not enforce a line length on commit messages summary and body, but please avoid very long summaries, and very long lines in the body, unless they are part of code blocks that must not be wrapped.
.SS Pull requests guidelines
.PP
Link to any related issue in the Pull Request message.
.PP
During the review, we recommend using fixups:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# SHA is the SHA of the commit you want to fix
git commit --fixup=SHA
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Once all the changes are approved, you can squash your commits:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git rebase -i --autosquash main
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
And force-push:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git push -f
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If this seems all too complicated, you can push or force-push each new commit, and we will squash them ourselves if needed, before merging.

.SH Insiders
.PP
\f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R] follows the \f[B]sponsorware\f[R] release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders.
Read on to learn what sponsorships achieve, how to become a sponsor to get access to Insiders, and what\[aq]s in it for you!
.SS What is Insiders?
.PP
\f[I]MkDocs Manpage Insiders\f[R] is a private fork of \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R], hosted as a private GitHub repository.
Almost^1^ all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately available to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository.
.PP
Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions.
When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R] and released for general availability, making them available to all users.
Bugfixes are always released in tandem.
.PP
Sponsorships start as low as \f[B]$10 a month\f[R].^2^
.SS What sponsorships achieve
.PP
Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this project time \[en] a very scarce resource \[en] which is spent on the development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.
The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.^3^
.PP
If you\[aq]re unsure if you should sponsor this project, check out the list of completed funding goals to learn whether you\[aq]re already using features that were developed with the help of sponsorships.
You\[aq]re most likely using at least a handful of them, thanks to our awesome sponsors!
.SS What\[aq]s in it for me?
.PP
The moment you become a sponsor, you\[aq]ll get \f[B]immediate access to 0 additional features\f[R] that you can start using right away, and which are currently exclusively available to sponsors:
.SS How to become a sponsor
.PP
Thanks for your interest in sponsoring!
In order to become an eligible sponsor with your GitHub account, visit pawamoy\[aq]s sponsor profile (https://github.com/sponsors/pawamoy), and complete a sponsorship of \f[B]$10 a month or more\f[R].
You can use your individual or organization GitHub account for sponsoring.
.PP
\f[B]Important\f[R]: If you\[aq]re sponsoring \f[B]\[at]pawamoy (https://github.com/sponsors/pawamoy)\f[R] through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to <pawamoy@pm.me> with the name of your organization and the GitHub account of the individual that should be added as a collaborator.^4^

If you sponsor publicly, you\[aq]re automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R].
Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you\[aq]ll be a silent +1.
You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards.
.SS Funding 
.SS Goals
.PP
The following section lists all funding goals.
Each goal contains a list of features prefixed with a checkmark symbol, denoting whether a feature is already available or planned, but not yet implemented.
When the funding goal is hit, the features are released for general availability.
.SS Goals completed
.PP
This section lists all funding goals that were previously completed, which means that those features were part of Insiders, but are now generally available and can be used by all users.
.SS $ 500 \[em] PlasmaVac User Guide

[Project] MkDocs plugin to generate a manpage from the documentation site
.SS Frequently asked questions
.SS Compatibility
.RS
.PP
We\[aq]re building an open source project and want to allow outside collaborators to use \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R] locally without having access to Insiders.
Is this still possible?
.RE
.PP
Yes.
Insiders is compatible with \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R].
Almost all new features and configuration options are either backward-compatible or implemented behind feature flags.
Most Insiders features enhance the overall experience, though while these features add value for the users of your project, they shouldn\[aq]t be necessary for previewing when making changes to content.
.SS Payment
.RS
.PP
We don\[aq]t want to pay for sponsorship every month.
Are there any other options?
.RE
.PP
Yes.
You can sponsor on a yearly basis by switching your GitHub account to a yearly billing cycle (https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-billing-and-payments-on-github/changing-the-duration-of-your-billing-cycle).
If for some reason you cannot do that, you could also create a dedicated GitHub account with a yearly billing cycle, which you only use for sponsoring (some sponsors already do that).

.SS Terms

.PP
Are we allowed to use Insiders under the same terms and conditions as \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R]?
.RE
.PP
Yes.
Whether you\[aq]re an individual or a company, you may use \f[I]MkDocs Manpage Insiders\f[R] precisely under the same terms as \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R], which are given by the ISC License.
However, we kindly ask you to respect our \f[B]fair use policy\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
Please \f[B]don\[aq]t distribute the source code\f[R] of Insiders.
You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, privately fork or mirror it, but please don\[aq]t make the source code public, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy.
.IP \[bu] 2
If you cancel your subscription, you\[aq]re automatically removed as a collaborator and will miss out on all future updates of Insiders.
However, you may \f[B]use the latest version\f[R] that\[aq]s available to you \f[B]as long as you like\f[R].
Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks (https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/removing-a-collaborator-from-a-personal-repository).
.PP

.IP "1." 3
.PP
In general, every new feature is first exclusively released to sponsors, but sometimes upstream dependencies enhance existing features that must be supported by \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R].\ ↩
.IP "2." 3
.PP
Note that $10 a month is the minimum amount to become eligible for Insiders.
While GitHub Sponsors also allows to sponsor lower amounts or one-time amounts, those can\[aq]t be granted access to Insiders due to technical reasons.
Such contributions are still very much welcome as they help ensuring the project\[aq]s sustainability.\ ↩
.IP "3." 3
.PP
Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned.
That\[aq]s not great and very unpredictable.
The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R], you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly.\ ↩
.IP "4." 3
.PP
It\[aq]s currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users.
Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to <pawamoy@pm.me>, stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository.
We\[aq]re working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler.
To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e.
a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring.
After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations.\ ↩
.IP "5." 3
.PP
If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle.
This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn\[aq]t effective.
All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe.
As we don\[aq]t receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn\[aq]t offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable.\ ↩
.SH Getting started with Insiders
.PP
\f[I]MkDocs Manpage Insiders\f[R] is a compatible drop-in replacement for \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R], and can be installed similarly using \f[V]pip\f[R] or \f[V]git\f[R].
Note that in order to access the Insiders repository, you need to become an eligible sponsor of \[at]pawamoy on GitHub.
.SS Installation
.SS with PyPI Insiders
.PP
PyPI Insiders (https://pawamoy.github.io/pypi-insiders/) is a tool that helps you keep up-to-date versions of Insiders projects in the PyPI index of your choice (self-hosted, Google registry, Artifactory, etc.).
.PP
See how to install it (https://pawamoy.github.io/pypi-insiders/#installation) and how to use it (https://pawamoy.github.io/pypi-insiders/#usage).
.SS with pip (ssh/https)
.PP
\f[I]MkDocs Manpage Insiders\f[R] can be installed with \f[V]pip\f[R] using SSH (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install git+ssh://git\[at]github.com/pawamoy-insiders/mkdocs-manpage.git
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or using HTTPS:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install git+https://${GH_TOKEN}\[at]github.com/pawamoy-insiders/mkdocs-manpage.git
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
How to get a GitHub personal access token
.PP
The \f[V]GH_TOKEN\f[R] environment variable is a GitHub token.
It can be obtained by creating a personal access token (https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) for your GitHub account.
It will give you access to the Insiders repository, programmatically, from the command line or GitHub Actions workflows:
.IP "1." 3
Go to <https://github.com/settings/tokens>
.IP "2." 3
Click on Generate a new token (https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
.IP "3." 3
Enter a name and select the \f[V]repo\f[R] (https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes) scope
.IP "4." 3
Generate the token and store it in a safe place
.PP
Note that the personal access token must be kept secret at all times, as it allows the owner to access your private repositories.
.SS with pip (self-hosted)
.PP
Self-hosting the Insiders package makes it possible to depend on \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R] normally, while transparently downloading and installing the Insiders version locally.
It means that you can specify your dependencies normally, and your contributors without access to Insiders will get the public version, while you get the Insiders version on your machine.
.PP
Limitation
.PP
With this method, there is no way to force the installation of an Insiders version rather than a public version.
If there is a public version that is more recent than your self-hosted Insiders version, the public version will take precedence.
Remember to regularly update your self-hosted versions by uploading latest distributions.
.PP
You can build the distributions for Insiders yourself, by cloning the repository and using build (https://pypi.org/project/build/) to build the distributions, or you can download them from our GitHub Releases (https://github.com/pawamoy-insiders/mkdocs-manpage/releases).
You can upload these distributions to a private PyPI-like registry (Artifactory (https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/pypi-repositories), Google Cloud (https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/python), pypiserver (https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/), etc.)
with Twine (https://pypi.org/project/twine/):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# download distributions in \[ti]/dists, then upload with:
twine upload --repository-url https://your-private-index.com \[ti]/dists/*
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
You might also need to provide a username and password/token to authenticate against the registry.
Please check Twine\[aq]s documentation (https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
.PP
You can then configure pip (or other tools) to look for packages into your package index.
For example, with pip:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip config set global.extra-index-url https://your-private-index.com/simple
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Note that the URL might differ depending on whether your are uploading a package (with Twine) or installing a package (with pip), and depending on the registry you are using (Artifactory, Google Cloud, etc.).
Please check the documentation of your registry to learn how to configure your environment.
.PP
\f[B]We kindly ask that you do not upload the distributions to public registries, as it is against our Terms of use.\f[R]
.PP
Full example with \f[V]pypiserver\f[R]
.PP
In this example we use pypiserver (https://pypi.org/project/pypiserver/) to serve a local PyPI index.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install --user pypiserver
# or pipx install pypiserver

# create a packages directory
mkdir -p \[ti]/.local/pypiserver/packages

# run the pypi server without authentication
pypi-server run -p 8080 -a . -P . \[ti]/.local/pypiserver/packages &
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
We can configure the credentials to access the server in \f[V]\[ti]/.pypirc\f[R] (https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pypirc/):
\&.pypirc
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[distutils]
index-servers =
    local

[local]
repository: http://localhost:8080
username:
password:
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
We then clone the Insiders repository, build distributions and upload them to our local server:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
# clone the repository
git clone git\[at]github.com:pawamoy-insiders/mkdocs-manpage
cd mkdocs-manpage

# install build
pip install --user build
# or pipx install build

# checkout latest tag
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)

# build the distributions
pyproject-build

# upload them to our local server
twine upload -r local dist/* --skip-existing
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Finally, we configure pip, and for example PDM (https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/), to use our local index to find packages:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip config set global.extra-index-url http://localhost:8080/simple
pdm config pypi.extra.url http://localhost:8080/simple
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Now when running \f[V]pip install mkdocs-manpage\f[R], or resolving dependencies with PDM, both tools will look into our local index and find the Insiders version.
\f[B]Remember to update your local index regularly!\f[R]
.SS with git
.PP
Of course, you can use \f[I]MkDocs Manpage Insiders\f[R] directly from \f[V]git\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
git clone git\[at]github.com:pawamoy-insiders/mkdocs-manpage
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When cloning from \f[V]git\f[R], the package must be installed:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
pip install -e mkdocs-manpage
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Upgrading
.PP
When upgrading Insiders, you should always check the version of \f[I]MkDocs Manpage\f[R] which makes up the first part of the version qualifier.
For example, a version like \f[V]8.x.x.4.x.x\f[R] means that Insiders \f[V]4.x.x\f[R] is currently based on \f[V]8.x.x\f[R].
.PP
If the major version increased, it\[aq]s a good idea to consult the changelog and go through the steps to ensure your configuration is up to date and all necessary changes have been made.
